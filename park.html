                This national park, located in the extreme south-western tip of Java on the Sunda shelf, 
                includes the Ujung Kulon peninsula and several offshore islands and encompasses the natural 
                reserve of Krakatoa. In addition to its natural beauty and geological interest – particularly 
                for the study of inland volcanoes – it contains the largest remaining area of lowland rainforests 
                in the Java plain. Several species of endangered 
                plants and animals can be found there, the Javan rhinoceros being the most seriously under threat.

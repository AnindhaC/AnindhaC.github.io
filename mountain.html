                Located some 4 hours drive from Surabaya, the capital of East Java, 
                Mount Bromo is a part of the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park that covers a massive area of 
                800 square km. 
                While it may be small when measured against other volcanoes in Indonesia, 
                the magnificent Mt Bromo will not disappoint with its spectacular views and dramatic landscapes. 
                At 2,392 meters tall, Mt Bromo is not among the tallest of Indonesiaâ€™s mountains but its stunning 
                beauty lies in its incredible setting.

                Pink Beach, or Pantai Merah, as it is aptly named, is one of seven pink beaches on the planet,
                 and is just one of the many amazing features of Komodo Island that make it truly a Natural Wonder
                  of Nature. This exceptional beach gets its striking color from microscopic animals called
                   Foraminifera, which produces a red pigment on the coral reefs. 
                   For this reason, it is called Red Beach in the local tongue. 
                   When the tiny fragments of red coral combine with the white sands, this produces the soft 
                   pink color that is visible along the shoreline. Aside from Pink Beach itself, 
                   a few small segments along Komodoâ€™s eastern bay also have a pinkish tint.
